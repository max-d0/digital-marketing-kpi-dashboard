Project Overview
========
This project provides a basic monthly performance analysis of digital media marketing campaigns during the month of February. The purpose is to provide a holistic view of February's marketing KPI's, as well as provide a cost impact analysis, and identify areas for potential optimization in budget allocation.

Interactive dashboards can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/max.d4182/viz/MarketingCampaignPerformanceAnalysis_17275645130830/CampaignPerformanceDashboard).

Pandas used to prepare data for dashboard can be found [here](#jupyter-notebook)

Summary of Insights
===========

- Social media campaigns show high conversion rates but lower-than-expected return on investment (ROI), suggesting potential inefficiencies.
- Multimedia campaigns consistently generate the highest number of impressions but exhibit significantly lower click-through rates (CTR) compared to other channels
- Influencer campaigns drive both higher lead conversion and return on investment (ROI), but cost efficiency is mixed.

Recommendations
===========
- Further analysis is warranted to explore the scalability of high-performing, cost-efficient campaigns.
- Investigation into the discrepancy between social media campaign's strong conversion rate and suboptimal cost efficiency could reveal opportunities for optimization.
